# Collected Works of Warren S. McCulloch
This repository contains selected chapters and photographs from the _Collected Works of Warren S. McCulloch_.

Most of McCulloch’s works can be found elsewhere on the internet, but interspersed in the _Collected Works of Warren S. McCulloch_ are reflections and anecdotes about McCulloch written by his friends that are not available elsewhere. There are supposedly only about 300 copies of the _Collected Works of Warren S. McCulloch_, so these chapters can be hard to find.

## Who was Warren S. McCulloch?
__Short Answer__: McCulloch and Walter Pitts authored the famous “[A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02478259)” that directly inspired the fields of [automata theory](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400882618) and [neural networks](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0042519).

__Long Answer__: McCulloch’s friends thoughtfully describe the type of person he was in the chapters included in this repository. I’d recommend reading the [Introduction to Volume 1](https://github.com/ktmurray1999/warren-s-mcculloch/blob/main/volume%201/introduction_Jerome_Y_Lettvin.pdf) and [Chapter 56 of Volume 2](https://github.com/ktmurray1999/warren-s-mcculloch/blob/main/volume%202/56_Jerome_Y_Lettvin.pdf), both written by Jerome Y. Lettvin, to get a sense as to how McCulloch’s friends revered him. I also recommend reading McCulloch’s book [_Embodiments of Mind_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529617/embodiments-of-mind/) for an introduction to his academic work.

## Who was Walter Pitts?
__Short Answer__: Pitts was McCulloch's frequent collaborator and coauthor.

__Long Answer__: I highly recommend reading [this wonderful essay on Pitt’s life](https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2000.0009) written by Neil Smalheiser. Smalheiser’s essay was my introduction to McCulloch, Pitts, and [Cybernetics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262730099/cybernetics/).

## Why did I make this repository?
McCulloch is a fascinating character who many, [including Marvin Minsky](https://youtu.be/yHValEmyKoM?si=Hhaj4AmFhzjxavmG), credit with creating the intellectual foundations of artificial intelligence. McCulloch and Pitts were truly the first people to create a neurocomputational model of intelligence, albeit a wrong one, and their work has had incomprehensible impacts on computing and technology. The fact that these chapters are not available on the internet seems unfair to McCulloch’s legacy.
